title: Lord don't move that mountain
---

Lord,请赐予我力量，让我过了明天这道难关。

明天，可能要决定我接下来的两年时光，在哪里度过。心里颇为忐忑。不过事到如今，不得不坦然面对，因为事到如今，都是自己一手造成的。

不过幸运的是，无论结果如何，总会有相应的道路给我走。若是去不了swinburne tech，那我就回大中国好啦。

耳边响起Etta James的Lord don't move that mountain，第一次听是在幸福来敲门影片中，着迷于歌词中的每一句话。如果再给我一次机会问我，would you like to hand yourself to lord，我一定会说，我愿意。

Lord don't move the mountain,
But give me strength to climb it
Please don't move that stumbling block,
But lead me Lord around it

Lord don't move the mountain,
But give me strength to climb it
Please don't move that stumbling block,
But lead me Lord around it

The way may not be easy,
You didn't say that it would be
For when our tribulations get too light,
We tend to stray from Thee.
Halleluja

Lord don't move the mountain,
But give me strength to climb it
Please don't move that stumbling block,
But lead me Lord around it

When my folk would slay me,
And these things they will try to do
Lord, don't touch him but within his heart,
Make him give his Heart to you.

Lord don't move the mountain,
But give me strength to climb it
Please don't move that stumbling block,
But lead me Lord around it
（by Doris Akers and Mahalia Jackson）
